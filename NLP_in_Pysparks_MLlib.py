# # NLP in Pyspark's MLlib
# 
# Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very trendy topic in the data science area today that is really handy for tasks like **chat bots**, movie or **product review analysis** and especially **tweet classification**. In this notebook, we will cover the **classification aspect of NLP** and go over the features that Spark has for cleaning and preparing your data for analysis. We will also touch on how to implement **ML Pipelines** to a few of our data processing steps to help make our code run a bit faster. 
# 
# As we learned in the NLP concept review lectures, the text you process must first be cleaned, tokenized and vectorized. Essentially, we need to covert our text into a vector of numbers. But how do we do that? Spark has a variety of built in functions to accomplish all of these tasks very easily. We will cover all of it here!
# 
# ### Agenda
# 
#     1. Review Data (quality check)
#     2. Clean up the data (remove puncuation, special characters, etc.)
#     3. Tokenize text data
#     4. Remove Stopwords
#     5. Zero index our label column
#     5. Create an ML Pipeline (to streamline steps 3-5)
#     6. Vectorize Text column
#          - Count Vectors
#          - TF-IDF
#          - Word2Vec
#     7. Train and Evaluate Model (classification)
#     8. View Predictions

# ## Read in Dataset
# 
# #### Kickstarter Dataset
# 
# ##### What is Kickstarter?
# "Kickstarter is an American public-benefit corporation based in Brooklyn, New York, that maintains a global crowdfunding platform, focused on creativity and merchandising. The company's stated mission is to "help bring creative projects to life". Kickstarter, has reportedly received more than $1.9 billion in pledges from 9.4 million backers to fund 257,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects.
# 
# People who back Kickstarter projects are offered tangible rewards or experiences in exchange for their pledges. This model traces its roots to subscription model of arts patronage, where artists would go directly to their audiences to fund their work" ~ Wikipedia
# 
# So, what if you can predict if a project will be or not to be able to get the money from their backers?
# 
# #### Content
# 
# The datastet contains the blurbs or short description of 215,513 projects runned along 2017, all written in english and all labeled with "successful" or "failed", if they get the money or not, respectively. From those texts you can train linguistics models for description, and even embeddings relative to the case.

# Replace Slashes and parenthesis with spaces
# You can test your script on line 7 of the df "(Legend of Zelda/Fable Inspired)"
df = df.withColumn("blurb",translate(col("blurb"), "/", " "))         .withColumn("blurb",translate(col("blurb"), "(", " "))         .withColumn("blurb",translate(col("blurb"), ")", " "))

# Take a pause here and go look at your Spark UI. You'll notice that only the "show strings" calls (as opposed to each of the data manipulation calls) are creating jobs. This is because of Sparks lazy computation. 
# 
# <br>
# So when you want to speed up your notebook those are some calls you can take out. 

# ## Prep Data for NLP 
# 
# Alright so here is where our analysis turns from basic text cleaning to actually turning our text into number (the backbone of NLP). These next several steps in our analysis are very unique to NLP. 

# ### Split text into words (Tokenizing)
# 
# Yo'll see a new column is added to our dataframe that we call "words". This column contains an array of strings as opposed to just a string (current data type of the blurb column).

# In[25]:


regex_tokenizer = RegexTokenizer(inputCol="blurb", outputCol="words", pattern="\\W")
raw_words = regex_tokenizer.transform(df)
raw_words.show(2,False)
raw_words.printSchema()


# ### Removing Stopwords
# 
# **Recall from the content review lecture**
# Recall that "stopwords" are any word that we feel would "distract" our model from performing it's best. This list can be customized, but for now, we will just use the default list. 

# In[26]:


# from pyspark.ml.feature import StopWordsRemover

# Define a list of stop words or use default list
remover = StopWordsRemover(inputCol="words", outputCol="filtered")
stopwords = remover.getStopWords() 

# Display default list
stopwords[:10]


# In[27]:


words_df = remover.transform(raw_words)
words_df.show(1,False)


# ### Now we need to encode state column to a column of indices
# 
# Remember that MLlib requres our dependent variable to not only be a numeric data type, but also zero indexed. We can Sparks handy built in StringIndexer function to accomplish this, just like we did in the classification lectures. 

# In[28]:


indexer = StringIndexer(inputCol="state", outputCol="label")
feature_data = indexer.fit(words_df).transform(words_df)
feature_data.show(5)
feature_data.printSchema()


# ## Creat an ML Pipeline
# 
# We could also create an ML Pipeline to accomplish the previous three steps in a more streamlined fashion. Pipelines allow users to combine any transformer call(s) and ONE estimator call in their ML workflow. Si a Pipeline can be a continuous set of transformer calls until you reach a point where you need to call ".fit()" which is an estimator call. 
# <br>
# 
# Notice in the script below that we reduced our .transform calls from 3 to 1. So the benefit here is not necessarily speed but a bit less and more organized code (always nice) and little more streamlined. This feature can be esspecially useful when you get to the point where you want to move your model into production. You can save this pipeline to be called on whenever you need to prep new text.

# Now take a look at the Spark UI again. You'll see the last 2 "countbyvalue" job ids for each one of these. If you take a look at how long it took each of those job ids to run, you will see that the second job id actually took just a bit less time to run. Since we do not have much data here it only saved us .2 seconds but that may translate to a couple of miniutes on a much larger df. 

# ## Converting text into vectors
# 
# We will test out the following three vectorizors:
# 
# 1. Count Vectors
# 2. TF-IDF
# 3. Word2Vec

# In[44]:


# Count Vector (count vectorizer and hashingTF are basically the same thing)
# cv = CountVectorizer(inputCol="filtered", outputCol="features")

# countVectorizer_features = model.transform(feature_data)

# Hashing TF
hashingTF = HashingTF(inputCol="filtered", outputCol="rawfeatures", numFeatures=20)
HTFfeaturizedData = hashingTF.transform(feature_data)

# TF-IDF
idf = IDF(inputCol="rawfeatures", outputCol="features")
idfModel = idf.fit(HTFfeaturizedData)
TFIDFfeaturizedData = idfModel.transform(HTFfeaturizedData)
TFIDFfeaturizedData.name = 'TFIDFfeaturizedData'

#rename the HTF features to features to be consistent
HTFfeaturizedData = HTFfeaturizedData.withColumnRenamed("rawfeatures","features")
HTFfeaturizedData.name = 'HTFfeaturizedData' #We will use later for printing


# In[45]:


# Word2Vec
word2Vec = Word2Vec(vectorSize=3, minCount=0, inputCol="filtered", outputCol="features")
model = word2Vec.fit(feature_data)

W2VfeaturizedData = model.transform(feature_data)
# W2VfeaturizedData.show(1,False)

# W2Vec Dataframes typically has negative values so we will correct for that here so that we can use the Naive Bayes classifier
scaler = MinMaxScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol="scaledFeatures")

# Compute summary statistics and generate MinMaxScalerModel
scalerModel = scaler.fit(W2VfeaturizedData)

# rescale each feature to range [min, max].
scaled_data = scalerModel.transform(W2VfeaturizedData)
W2VfeaturizedData = scaled_data.select('state','blurb','label','scaledFeatures')
W2VfeaturizedData = W2VfeaturizedData.withColumnRenamed('scaledFeatures','features')

W2VfeaturizedData.name = 'W2VfeaturizedData' # We will need this to print later

# 
# Once we have our model and all the vectorizer the sky is really the limit! We could do any of the following for starters:
# 
# 1. Allow a user to input their own "blurb" and we could return a prediction of whether or not it would pass
# 2. If we had a time variable here, we could show the most popular words over time
# 3. Provide this algorithim to Kickstarter for prescreening so they can prioritize entries
