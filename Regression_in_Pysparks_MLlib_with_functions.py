# # Regression in PySpark's MLlib
# 
# PySpark offers 7 algorithms for regression which we will review in this lecture. The content of this notebook will be very similar to what we did in the classification lectures where we will see how to prep our data first, and then go over how to train and evaluate each model individually. 
# 
# **Recap from the Regression lecture**<br>
# Remember that regression problems require that the **dependent variable** in your dataset be continuous (like age or height) and not categorical like (young vs old, or fat vs skinny). Regression analysis tries to find the relationship between this variable (the dependent) and each of the independent variables which can be either continous or categorical. As with any machine learning problem, the basic question of regression analysis is "what factors affect our outcome."
# 
# For example, some research questions that might be solved using regression anlaysis might be:
# 
# What factors effect...
# 
# 1. inflation rate and how we predict it longer term?
# 2. price increases upon demand
# 3. the height or weight of a person
# 4. crop yield of vegetation like corn or apple trees
# 5. income of a person
# 
# 
# ## Available Algorithms
# These are the regression algorithms Spark offers:
# 
# 1. Linear regression 
#      - most simplistic and easy to understand
# 2. Generalized linear regression (out of scope)
# 3. Decision tree regression 
#      - most basic of the tree algorithms)
# 4. Random forest regression 
#      - a bit more complex than decision tree as it is an ensemble method as it combines several models in order to produce one really great predictive model
# 5. Gradient-boosted tree regression 
#      - most complex of the tree algorithms as it takes a more hierarchical approach to learning making it more efficient
# 6. Survival regression (Out of scope)
# 7. Isotonic regression (Out of scope)

# ## Import Dataset
# 
# This is a dataset containing housing pricing data for California. Each row of data represents the median statistics for a block (eg. median income, median age of house, etc.). You could this data in a number of ways, but we will use it to predict the median house value. 
# 
# 
# ### About this dataset 
# 
# 1. longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
# 2. latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
# 3. housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
# 4. totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block
# 5. totalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block
# 6. population: Total number of people residing within a block
# 7. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
# 8. medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
# 9. medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
# 10. oceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

# ## Check for Multicollinearity
# 
# Multicollinearity generally occurs when there are high correlations between two or more predictor variables (your features column in your dataframe, also called independent variables). In other words, one predictor variable can be used to predict the other. This creates redundant information, skewing the results in a regression model. 
# 
# An easy way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate correlation coefficients for all pairs of predictor variables. If the correlation coefficient, is exactly +1 or -1, this is called perfect multicollinearity, and one of the variables should be removed from the model if at all possible for the linear model to perform well.
# 
# Desicion trees on the other hand, make no assumptions on relationships between features. It just constructs splits on single features that improves classification, based on an impurity measure like Gini or entropy. If features A, B are heavily correlated, no /little information can be gained from splitting on B after having split on A. So it would typically get ignored in favor of C.
# 
# Of course a single decision tree is very vulnerable to overfitting, so one must either limit depth, prune heavily or preferly average many using an ensemble. Such problems get worse with many features and possibly also with co-variance but this problem occurs independently from multicolinearity.
# 
# MLlib offers two correlation coefficient statitics: **pearson** and **spearman**.

print(predictions.describe(['diff perct']).show())


# As you can see from the output above how much difference there was between the actual house price (label) and the prediction one as both a raw dollar value and the percentage difference. The summary we printed out shows that our model, on average was off by about -9 % which means that the model under valued houses since it's a negative value. These are really great statistics to be able to deliver to a client who does have any knowledge about machine learning and wants to know how useful or "good" your model is. 
# 
# If you want to save your model you can simply...

# In[39]:


# this path will create the folder if it does not exist
# I also like to create a unique identifier using a timestamp so i know when the model was created
from datetime import datetime
timestamp = str(datetime.now()) #return local time
path = 'Models/LRModel_'+timestamp
LR_BestModel.save(path)
