# # Gaussian Mixture Modeling in PySpark's MLlib 
# 
# As we discussed in the concept review lecture, GMM is a "soft" clustering method that provides a probability of how associated a data point is with a cluster as opposed to simply which cluster the data point is associated with. It works esspecially well for data that has multiple distributions, but can be used for any kind of data.
# 
# If you would like to learn even more about GMM I recommend the following article: https://towardsdatascience.com/gaussian-mixture-models-explained-6986aaf5a95

# ## About this data
# 
# Sample Sales Data, Order Info, Sales, Customer, Shipping, etc., Used for Segmentation, Customer Analytics, Clustering and More. Inspired for retail analytics. This was originally used for Pentaho DI Kettle, But I found the set could be useful for Sales Simulation training.

# ## Import some libraries we will need
# 
# You will notice that some of these are pythonic which means they won't distribute accross our dataframe, but we will only use them on situations were distribution is not usually necessary. I always try to use PySpark functions where ever I can, but sometimes the functionality I need is not available. In these cases I lean back on my trusty Python libraries :)

# ## Reflection
# 
# Looks the 5 clusters that our model identified range in size quite a bit. There is one cluster that only has 7 cases in it as opposed to 1,307 in the largest cluster. If we were using this dataset to target customers, we may want to focus our efforts on the largest group first as we would have more bange for our buck.

# # Conclusions
# 
# Of the 5 clusters, the first one seems to buy for quality (highest price per item and max sales), while the last cluster seems to be the "buy in bulk" shoppers. Cluster 3 seems to be more of a bargain hunter (lowest price each and avg sales)
